# chaos4ever.github.io
Web site for chaos development.

Repository structure:

- `master` branch: Holds the source code for the web site.
- `gh-pages` branch: Holds the "compiled" version of the web site, that is published to e.g. http://chaosdev.io and http://chaos4ever.github.io

To publish updated versions of the site, use the `publish.sh` script. It makes certain rough assumptions of the folder structured on your machine; see the script for the full details.
