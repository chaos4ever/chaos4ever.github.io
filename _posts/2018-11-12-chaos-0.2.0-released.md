Today, we are happy to announce the immediate availability of chaos 0.2.0

Here is an excerpt from the release notes, as taken from https://github.com/chaos4ever/chaos/releases/tag/0.2.0

## General release notes

* Fixed the bootup sequence to actually load `cluido` properly, from the ramdisk using the `boot`, `virtual_file_system`,`fat` and `initial_ramdisk` servers together. This item itself is worthy of its own story; I have blogged about it at great length here: http://perlun.eu.org/en/2017/12/30/chaos-why-is-the-boot-server-unable-to-read-the-startup-script
* Changed bootloader from `grub-legacy` to GRUB 2, the current version of GNU GRUB. This helped in supporting the next bulletpoint, namely:
* Made it possible to boot from a USB pen device. Just use `cp` (on Linux) or Rufus (on Windows) to write the `.iso` to the proper device and you should be able to boot it. Please, give it a try and share any feedback about this here in our GitHub repo!
* Added CI building of Docker images on each push to `master`. Our image can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/chaosdev/chaos/), and you should be able to run it by simply executing `docker run -it chaosdev/chaos`. (The container uses `qemu` under the hood, to simulate a physical machine.)
